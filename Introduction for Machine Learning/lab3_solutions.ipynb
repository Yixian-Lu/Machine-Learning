You will implement the version labelled as **Option 1**, which is much simpler than Option 2. To do this, for each fold, keep one split for testing, one split for validation, and the remaining splits for training. \n","\n","For this, you will need to first modify the `train_test_k_fold()` function from earlier. Call the function `train_val_test_k_fold()`, and it should now return the train, validation and test splits per fold instead of just train and test. For each fold, reserve one split as the test set, pick any one of the other splits as the validation set, and put the remaining splits together as the training set."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"T-fIPCF7XkNl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635784273465,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Josiah Wang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg5qguWdcDUuyRkXn35iKMYh0x0dcYIXKCyJiid=s64","userId":"15502581881617051970"}},"outputId":"467faf09-7224-434c-b2d6-37de0bc8fc70"},"source":["def train_val_test_k_fold(n_folds, n_instances, random_generator=default_rng()):\n","    \"\"\" Generate train and test indices at each fold.\n","    \n","    Args:\n","        n_folds (int): Number of folds\n","        n_instances (int): Total number of instances\n","        random_generator (np.random.Generator): A random generator\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list: a list of length n_folds.
